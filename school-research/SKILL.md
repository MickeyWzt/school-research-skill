name: school-research
description: Create deep research profiles for one specific school, college, university, boarding school, international school, or academic program. Use when the user names a particular school and asks for school research, admissions requirements, deadline checks, tuition or scholarship research, program fit, campus or student-life research, application strategy, risks, source-backed school briefs, or a one-school due-diligence report.

# School Research

## Overview

Use this skill to turn one named school into an evidence-backed research profile for application planning. Prioritize current official sources, separate verified facts from interpretation, and produce a practical single-school brief with risks and next actions.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the research target.
   - Confirm the exact school name, campus, country, student level, intended major or curriculum, applicant status, entry year, and application route.
   - Disambiguate similarly named schools before researching.
   - If student context is missing, still research the school generally and mark applicant-fit judgments as conditional.

2. Build a source plan.
   - Use current web research for admissions requirements, deadlines, tuition, scholarships, rankings, policy, and program availability unless the user explicitly says not to browse.
   - Prefer official school, admissions, department, financial aid, international student, and Common Data Set pages.
   - Use rankings, forums, blogs, consultants, and student reviews only as secondary context.
   - Record accessed date for unstable facts.
   - For deep research, cover the minimum source set in `references/research-standards.md` before writing the final report. If any source category cannot be found, state that gap.

3. Extract decision facts.
   - Confirm program fit, admissions route, required curriculum, standardized tests, English requirements, GPA or grade expectations, recommendation letters, essays, interviews, portfolios, deadlines, tuition, aid, housing, student outcomes, and application platform.
   - Mark facts as `verified`, `inferred`, or `unclear`.
   - Keep direct quotes short and cite source links.

4. Evaluate fit.
   - Separate academic fit, admissions competitiveness, financial fit, environment fit, and strategic value.
   - Use reach/target/likely only if the user provides enough applicant context; otherwise describe selectivity and required evidence.
   - Avoid deterministic admissions claims. Phrase estimates as judgments based on available evidence.

5. Produce the requested artifact.
   - For quick research, answer with a concise school profile and action list.
   - For deeper research, produce a full single-school due-diligence report, source log, uncertainties, and next actions.
   - If the user writes in Chinese, output in Chinese unless they request otherwise. Preserve official English school and program names.

## Output Standards

- Lead with the decision-relevant conclusion before details.
- Cite sources for each school-specific factual claim.
- Include concrete dates for deadlines and accessed dates for web facts.
- Distinguish current facts from historical data or reputation signals.
- Flag risks such as outdated pages, country-specific requirements, unavailable aid for international students, or unclear test policies.
- Do not call the work "deep research" unless admissions, program, cost/aid, international/applicant support, student life, outcomes, and official data/profile sources have all been attempted.
- End with the next 3-5 actions the student should take.

## Resources

- Read `references/research-standards.md` when planning source strategy or handling uncertain admissions facts.
- Read `references/output-templates.md` when creating a school profile, due-diligence report, application checklist, or source log.
- Use `assets/single_school_profile.csv` as a starter table when the user wants a spreadsheet-style one-school research file.
